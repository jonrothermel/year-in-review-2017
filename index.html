  <strong>Hello, friends!</strong> 2017 has been one heck of a year for me. I've learned a lot of new things like web coding (which is how I built this website for you), designing motion graphics, lighting, and more. Whether we've known each other for a long time, or we just met recently, I'd like to share my year month-by-month so you can see what I've been up to all year. 
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
  And of course I've been taking pictures all year so there will be a lot of images of my favorite things I've learned and done!

      I don't think I made any big resolutions at the beginning of 2017 except that I wanted to read more. 
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-2">
        <strong>Mission accomplished!</strong> I have read a lot of books in 2017 from <em>Accounting for the Numberphobic</em> by Dawn Fotopulos and <em>Made To Stick</em> by Chip and Dan Heath.

        I also became a Gregular last January at <a href="http://www.gregoryscoffee.com/" target="_blank">Gregory's coffee</a>. I've since quit Starbucks almost completely because I think Gregory's is better.

        I was also doing a bit of video work for our school's video journalism club, Empire State TV. This is a piece that I filmed and edited about the history of our school. Isabelle McCauley wrote the episode and found all of the pictures.

       In February, one of the biggest highlights of my year was seeing a film I made shown on the big screen in a real movie theater. The King's College has the house history competition every 3 years. For the house history competition, your house makes a film about some aspect of the history of your house. 
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph-2">
        The House of Ronald Reagan made a really cool film that was super sweet to see in the theater with full, high-quality sound.

      <p class="paragraph-2">
      I also made one of the worst decisions ever in February. That decision was to go to Times Square right after a very large snow storm. Brilliant, right? When I stepped out of the subway station, the first thing I did was step in a massive, hidden, icy puddle that completely soaked my foot. Traveling to and from Times Square took 2 hours. 10/10 would <em><strong>not</strong></em> recommend.

       <p class="paragraph-2">
        Over my spring break, I read <em>Amusing Ourselves To Death</em> by Neil Postman. In his book, Postman talks about the way television may overtake our culture. Unlike the dystopian future of <em>1984</em> by George Orwell where the government takes over by force, he relates TV to being more like the government in <em>Brave New World</em> by Aldous Huxley. In <em>Brave New World</em>, Huxley describes a government that the people allow to control them. 
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-2">
        Do we allow TV or social media to control us? Should we allow those things to control us? One of the most striking things about this book was realizing how I had allowed social media to control my life.
