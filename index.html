  <strong>Hello, friends!</strong> 2017 has been one heck of a year for me. I've learned a lot of new things like web coding (which is how I built this website for you), designing motion graphics, lighting, and more. Whether we've known each other for a long time, or we just met recently, I'd like to share my year month-by-month so you can see what I've been up to all year. 
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
  And of course I've been taking pictures all year so there will be a lot of images of my favorite things I've learned and done!
